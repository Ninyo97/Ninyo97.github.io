# New Blog

Writing some math:
$$
\min_{S, \theta} \sum_{i \in S} \ell(m_\theta(x_i), y_i)
$$

And how about some code!
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        print(i)
    else:
        print("i is not 5")
```

And also finally, we should add a table:

|Acc| $n = 0$ |
|:-:|:-:|
|baseline 1 | 0.85|
